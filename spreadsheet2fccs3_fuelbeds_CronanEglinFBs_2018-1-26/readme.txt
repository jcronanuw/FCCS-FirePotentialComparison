These include primarily fuelbeds developed by Anne Andreu and submitted on August 9, 2016. This was the set submitted to the 
Joint Fire Science Program by Jim Cronan along with the Joint Fire Science Program Final Report titled: "
Detailed fuelbed characterization, mapping and future fire hazard assessment for Eglin Air Force Base, FL"; 
JFSP Project ID Number: 13-3-01-26.

Four fuelbeds were copied and pasted multiple times to create new fuelbeds with different mean fire return interval (mfri) categories
for the late-stage herbicide restoration fuelbeds. Initially Anne Andreu developed four fuelbeds for this treatment type:
41413, 41414, 41415, and 41416. I needed fuelbeds to represent these in each additional mfri category (2,3, and 4), and each
upland topographic position (3 and 4)
